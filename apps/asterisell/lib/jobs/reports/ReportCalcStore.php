/**
 * Contains values to use for producing a report.
 *
 * CONTRACTS:
 * A single store object can be used/shared from different reports of the same report set.,
 * In this way the store can be calculated only one time, and then used from reports of the
 * same type, instantiated from the scheduler, for example:
 * - invoices
 * - billing reports
 * In other words, a ReportSet can reuse the same report store.
 *
 * NOTE if a report requires only the data of an organization,
 * this approach load the data of all organizations,
 * but in practice:
 * - this work is done on the MySQL side and it is rather efficient in any case,
 * because all the CDRs in the data range must be scan in any case,
 * - usually invoices and other reports are generated in batch sessions, and info must be reused
 * between different organizations, and in these cases the calculated info can be reused
